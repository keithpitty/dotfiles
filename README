In user's home directory the following are defined:

*  the .bashrc file contains one line:

. ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc

*  the .bash_profile sources the .bashrc as follows:

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  source ~/.bashrc
fi

In the user's .ssh directory a symbolic link to the ssh config using:

  ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/ssh/config ~/.ssh/config
  
That is all.
